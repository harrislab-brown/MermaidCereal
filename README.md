# MermaidCereal
N-body magnetocapillary code and simulation data

## Introduction
This code complements the article "Mermaid Cereal: Interactions and Pattern Formation in a Macroscopic Magnetocapillary SALR System" at FILL IN. This code is used to simulate magnetocapillary interactions in both confined and periodic geometries. For the code provided, a collection of $n$ disks are evolved through time which are able to interact with one another via capillary and magnetic effects.

Sample final configurations for various packing fractions are available to highlight the pattern formation which occurs due to the interaction potential having competing attractive (capillary) and repulsive (magnetic) effects.

## Setup and Usage
For this project, we focused on simulating magnetocapillary interactions in both confined and periodic geometries. For each of the scenarios, 2 Matlab functions and 2 Matlab scripts are provided to set up, simulate, and visualize the pattern formation which arise as a function of system parameters, packing fraction, and boundary geometry.
